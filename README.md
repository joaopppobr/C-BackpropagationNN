# C-BackpropagationNN
A Backpropagation Neural Network in C

This code is an adaptation of the concepts found in these sources: 

[This is a Python version](https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-backpropagation-algorithm-scratch-python/) . Really useful if you never implemented a backpropagation NN before.

[This is a C implementation](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse599/01wi/admin/Assignments/bpn.html). Much of this code was based off this website. Really useful code, but with no comments/documentation, so you have to figure things out yourself.

[This is a brief C introduction](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~jxb/INC/nn.html)to building a backpropagation NN. Some of the code used in this repository was based off here as well.

[This is some further reading](https://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/rojas/neural/chapter/K7.pdf) if you want to get mode specific on the logic and math of a Backpropagation NN.
